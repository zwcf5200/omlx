"""Patch mlx-vlm's Qwen3.5 MoE ``Model.sanitize`` to preserve MTP weights.

Same fix as ``qwen35_vlm_model.py`` but for the MoE variant in
``mlx_vlm/models/qwen3_5_moe/qwen3_5_moe.py``. The expert weight repacking
(``gate_up_proj`` split into ``gate_proj`` / ``up_proj``) follows the pinned
upstream sanitize body.
